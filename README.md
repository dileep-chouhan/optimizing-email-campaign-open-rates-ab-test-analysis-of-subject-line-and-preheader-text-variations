# Optimizing Email Campaign Open Rates: A/B Test Analysis of Subject Line and Preheader Text Variations

**Overview:**

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted on email subject lines and preheader texts to determine the most effective combinations for maximizing open rates.  The analysis utilizes statistical methods to identify significant differences in open rates between various subject line and preheader text variations, ultimately aiming to improve customer engagement and conversion rates.  The data is processed and visualized to provide clear insights into which email subject line and preheader text combinations performed best.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the A/B test results to the console, including statistical significance measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as open rates for each variation.  Additionally, the script will generate visualization plots (e.g., bar charts comparing open rates) saved as PNG files in the project directory. These plots provide a visual representation of the A/B test results, facilitating a clear understanding of the most effective subject line and preheader text combinations.  The specific file names of the generated plots may vary.


**Data:**

The project requires a CSV file named `email_campaign_data.csv` (or a file specified within the `main.py` script) in the same directory as the scripts. This CSV should contain columns representing the subject line, preheader text, and the number of opens and sends for each variation.  A sample `email_campaign_data.csv` file is provided in the `data/` directory for demonstration purposes.
